## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS (saved as CSS)
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that I can change how an image is cropped with the help of object-position.

```css
img {
  object-fit: cover;
  object-position: 0% 25%;
}
```

This is my first challenge with some JavaScript. At first I hade two separate share buttons, but it made more sense to change the background-color with JS in the end. Unexpectedly the JS part was easy compared to the rest of the challenge.

### Continued development

I wanted to include the possibility to close the share element by clicking outside the share element but this seems to complicated for me (for now). üòê

It is probably barely visible, but the small triangle pseudo-element on larger devices does not have a box-shadow as the rest of the element. I tried adding the shadow, but somehow the stacking of z-indexes did not work. I recreated the problem on CodePen and it worked fine, but I could not figure out how to apply my solution there to this challenge. Idk, this frustrated me more than it should.

The property overflow: visible; on my container was not ideal, I assume. Otherwise my share element was cut off, but now I had to set the border-radius for my image two times.

I had a lot of trouble with the share element to make it look like it does in the design. This took way longer than I thought. The tablet version was one of the problems I had. I did not use fixed widths to make my solution more responsive, but that way the share element did not stay at the same position. I used media queries and a slightly different design of the element to get an acceptable result.
